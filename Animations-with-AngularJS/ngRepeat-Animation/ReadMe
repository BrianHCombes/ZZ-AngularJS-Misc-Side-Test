  I've already gotten animations to work but from a CSS standpoint. So the only 
  note here is say (so far) my animation approach is to essentially always have
  the element (to animate) active but set to size and opacity of zero (via CSS)
  as the default. Then animate to full size and opacity.

  Have found << tables >> using ng-repeat are tough to animate smoothly. 
  The idea is to have a smooth opening for the table. One critical CSS 
  property that helps smooth an opening is the << height >> property. By 
  using the height property the lines of the list expand on their own rather
  than being forced open by an expanding font size. This seems to smooth out
  the transition.

  Also, have located the transition property in (usually so far) more than one
  CSS class group. But also found it's needed in only one CSS class group
  depending on the effect you want. So play around with this to see what you
  like best. case in point is to compare the Quick Menu animation to the
  Local Menu animation. Here's their locations:
  << C:\xampp\htdocs\TTD-ViewNav-Home\ttd-vn-home\resources\common-templates\template_menu\template-menu-component.html >>
  << C:\xampp\htdocs\TTD-ViewNav-Home\ttd-vn-home\resources\common-templates\top_menu\buy_price\buy_price.html >>
  Look at the CSS classes at the top of these HTML files.
